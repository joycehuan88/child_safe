                                Immunisation is the most significant public health intervention in the last 200 years, providing a
                                safe and efficient way to prevent the spread of many diseases that cause hospitalisation, serious
                                ongoing health conditions and sometimes death. It is one of the best ways to protect yourself, your
                                children and safeguard the health of future generations.</p>
                            <p>Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting a child from diseases that can cause
                                serious illness and sometimes death. If most children are vaccinated, this indirectly protects people
                                who are still susceptible to the disease as they are less likely to come into contact with someone
                                who is carrying the pathogens â€“ a concept known as herd immunity. Herd immunity can protect
                                those who are too young to be vaccinated or cannot be vaccinated because of medical conditions
                                (e.g. receiving chemotherapy), and those who do not respond adequately to immunisation. The
                                more people who vaccinate their children, the greater our ability to control serious vaccine
                                preventable diseases.</p>

                            <p>Child abuse is any action by another person â€“ adult or child â€“ that causes significant harm to a
                                child. It can be physical, sexual or emotional, but can just as often be about a lack of love, care and
                                attention. We know that neglect, whatever form it takes, can be just as damaging to a child as
                                physical abuse.</p>
                            <h3>Recognising abusive behaviour in yourself</h3>
                            <p>You canâ€™t stop the anger</p>
                            <p>You feel emotionally disconnected from your child</p>
                            <p>Meeting the daily needs of your child seems impossible.</p>
                            <p>Other people have expressed concern.</p>
                            <h3>Tips for changing your reactions</h3>
                            <p>Learn what is age appropriate and what is not</p>
                            <p>Develop new parenting skills</p>
                            <p>Get professional help.</p>
                            <p>Learn how you can get your emotions under control.</p>

                            <p>Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which makes a person feel offended,
                                humiliated and/or intimidated where that reaction is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
                            <h3>Help and protect your child:</h3>
                            <p>1. be suspicious if an adult wants to spend time alone with your child</p>
                            <p>2. be wary of people who are overly affectionate or generous with gifts to your child</p>
                            <p>3. be careful about the company your children keep. Watch childrenâ€™s behaviour for signs of stress
                                â€” their reactions to certain individuals may tell you something</p>
                            <p>4. teach children about being safe in a way that does not frighten them</p>
                            <p>5. teach children that the parts of their bodies covered by underwear are private</p>
                            <p>6. teach children anatomical names for body parts, such as penis or vagina</p>
                            <p>7. encourage children to tell someone they trust if anyone tries to touch their private parts</p>
                            <p>8. carefully consider who else you might want your children to tell if you are not available â€” let
                                your children know these contact options.</p>
                            <p>9. speak to children who are under school age about personal safety in simple language and
                                repeat the same rules often â€” play â€˜what ifâ€™ games to reinforce the message</p>
                            <p>10. teach children of primary school age basic family safety rules and how to apply them in
                                potentially dangerous situations</p>
                            <p>11. assist adolescents to think independently, and to develop decision-making and assertiveness
                                skills</p>
                            <p>12. know who is supervising your children when they are away from home</p>
                            <p>13. listen to your children and trust what they say, even if it shocks you â€” children rarely make up
                                stories about sexual abuse.</p>
